# Fivetran Netsuite Streamlit App
## ðŸ“£ Overview

The [Fivetran Netsuite Streamlit app](https://fivetran-netsuite.streamlit.app/) leverages data from the Fivetran Netsuite connector and Fivetran Netsuite data model to produce analytics ready reports. You may find the analytics ready reports within the pages of this Streamlit app (these may be found on the left pane). These dashboards have been constructed using a combination of the [netsuite2__balance_sheet](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite2.netsuite2__balance_sheet) and [netsuite2__income_statement](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite2.netsuite2__income_statement) models from the Fivetran [Netsuite dbt package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite). These dashboards provide an example of how you may analyze your Netsuite data.

By default this Streamlit app uses sample Dunder Mifflin Netsuite tickets data to generate the dashboards. This sample data is a replica of the `netsuite2__balance_sheet` and `netsuite2__income_statement` data model outputs. If you would like to leverage this app with your own data, you may follow the instructions within the below Installation and Deployment section.
